# Primordial Ooze Wordpress Theme

This is a very basic theme inspired by Armin Ronacherâ€™s blog, Thoughts and Writings. I wrote a little about the creation of the theme on my blog http://www.primordia.com/blog/2011/07/10/my-first-hand-coded-wordpress-theme/

The theme has almost no features. It barely has a header and footer. There is no ability to see old posts. There is no support for plugins.
